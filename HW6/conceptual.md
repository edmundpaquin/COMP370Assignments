What is refactoring? Give three examples of refactoring techniques.
    Changing code without chanhging functionality. 1. renaming code, 2. modularizing. 3. making more efficeint. 
In a data science project, why does code naturally go through “phases” of messiness?
    This corresponds to the data science process we've looked at. As we refine our data set and data collection/organization/analysis techniques, the code changes. Of course, the complexity fo the code reflects the complexity of the real world problem. So as we simplify the problem and break it down, our code follows suit. 

What are three techniques for creating more modular code?
1. make functions 2. separate into different files based on the type of operation being performed. 3.
