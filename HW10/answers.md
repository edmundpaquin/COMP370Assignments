    1. When dealing with human coded data, it can be tempting to throw out data items that did not have perfect or majority agreement. Why is this a bad practice?
        Can neglect important cases that may be useful for data anlysis. 

    2. Consider the following analysis tasks. Rank them by the degree to which they are fishing expeditions. Explain your ranking.
        a. Measure the correlation between outside temperature and the amount of foot traffic on St. Laurent on a Saturday night. Not fishing, specific goal in mind. 
        b. Identify the kinds of locations where people go on St. Laurent.
        Fishing. Little goal in mind, many potential new things to explore with this question, different times of year, etc. 
        c. Identify the dietary preferences of people who shop on St. Laurent.
        Slightly fihsing, but not too bad, as there is a specific goal in mind.

    3. For the most extreme fishing expedition identified in #1, explain how more work in the data annotation phase would avoid/limit the open-ness of the question.
    The data annotation phase is where we define the granularity of what we count as a "place". If the typology includes broad enough categories like restaurant, bar, grocery store, etc., then the measurement becomes feasible. If the categories are far too specific (down to individual restaurant names) then we are constantly fishing for some new place that has yet to be categorized.  

    4. Diagram and explain how the desire to use automated data annotation can lead to a secondary data science project.
    Creating an automated annotator involves data collection, data annotation (for training on humans), data analysis (checking error), then looping back to annotation and analysis to improve the tool, etc. 

    5. For each question below, identify the type of answer required (definition, process, or motivation) and give a precise answer for a young child audience (say somewhere around 5-6 years old).
        a. What is an airplane? definition
        b. Why do we have stoplights? motivation
        c. When is it appropriate to yell “Fire” in a crowded room? definition
        d. How do you eat an apple? process.
